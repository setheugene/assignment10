bamazon

A Node app similar to Amazon that uses a SQL database to keep track of inventory. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.

On running the app, you will be provided with a list of products and prices and propted to use the unique ID for a product to make a selection. Next you will be asked how many you would like to purchase. Last you will be provided with an order review, how many of what you ordered and the final cost. You will be told if there is not enough in the inventory to complete your order.

Video demonstration of the working app is available in the repo.
